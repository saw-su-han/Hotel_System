/*
  Warnings:

  - The `roleId` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `permissions` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `permissions` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `role_permission` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `role_permission` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `roles` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `roles` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Changed the type of `role_id` on the `role_permission` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `permission_id` on the `role_permission` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
